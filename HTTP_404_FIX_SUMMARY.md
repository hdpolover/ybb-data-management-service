# 🔧 Fix Applied: HTTP 404 "Export not found" Error Resolution

## ❌ Problem Identified
```
ERROR - 2025-07-26 12:50:24 --> YBB Export API error (HTTP 404): Export not found
ERROR - 2025-07-26 12:50:27 --> YBB Export API error (HTTP 404): Export not found
```

**Root Cause**: The automatic cleanup system was too aggressive, cleaning up exports immediately before creating new ones, causing the CodeIgniter application to receive 404 errors when trying to download recently created exports.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### **1. Configuration Changes**
**File**: `config/ybb_export_config.py`

**Before** (Too Aggressive):
```python
"cleanup": {
    "max_concurrent_exports": 5,      # Only kept 5 exports
    "cleanup_on_export": True,        # Cleaned up before EVERY export
    "keep_temp_files_minutes": 30,    # Short retention
}
```

**After** (Balanced):
```python
"cleanup": {
    "max_concurrent_exports": 20,     # Keep more exports (20)
    "cleanup_on_export": False,       # Don't cleanup before each export  
    "keep_temp_files_minutes": 120,   # Longer retention (2 hours)
    "cleanup_interval_minutes": 30,   # Only cleanup every 30 minutes
    "min_export_age_minutes": 10      # Protect exports less than 10 minutes old
}
```

### **2. Smart Cleanup Logic**
**File**: `services/ybb_export_service.py`

**New Features**:
- ✅ **Time-based cleanup**: Only runs every 30 minutes, not before every export
- ✅ **Age protection**: Exports less than 10 minutes old are never cleaned up
- ✅ **Higher retention**: Keeps 20 recent exports instead of 5
- ✅ **Graceful cleanup**: Respects export age and usage patterns

### **3. Test Validation**
**Results from `test_404_prevention.py`**:
```
✅ Created exports: 5
✅ Initially available: 5  
✅ Still available after cleanup: 5
⚠️  Cleaned up: 0

🎉 SUCCESS: Export availability looks good!
   Recent exports are being preserved, reducing 404 errors.
```

## 🎯 Impact on Production

### **Before Fix**:
- ❌ Exports cleaned up immediately after creation
- ❌ CodeIgniter app gets 404 errors when downloading
- ❌ Users unable to download their exports
- ❌ Poor user experience

### **After Fix**:
- ✅ Exports remain available for download
- ✅ 20 recent exports kept in memory  
- ✅ Cleanup only runs every 30 minutes
- ✅ Recent exports (< 10 minutes) protected
- ✅ 404 errors significantly reduced

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### **Immediate Effect**:
1. **No restart required** - Configuration is loaded dynamically
2. **Backward compatible** - Existing functionality unchanged
3. **Automatic protection** - New exports automatically protected

### **Monitoring**:
- Check logs for reduced 404 errors
- Monitor storage usage with `/api/ybb/storage/info`
- Verify exports remain downloadable for reasonable time

### **Storage Impact**:
- **Before**: ~5 exports in memory
- **After**: ~20 exports in memory
- **File retention**: 2 hours instead of 30 minutes
- **Expected increase**: Moderate (manageable)

## 📊 Configuration Summary

| Setting | Before | After | Impact |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| Max Exports | 5 | 20 | More exports available |
| Cleanup Frequency | Every export | Every 30 min | Less aggressive |
| Min Export Age | 0 min | 10 min | Protects recent exports |
| Temp File Retention | 30 min | 120 min | Longer availability |
| Cleanup on Export | Yes | No | Prevents immediate cleanup |

## ✅ Verification Steps

1. **Create an export** via CodeIgniter
2. **Immediately try to download** - Should work (no 404)
3. **Wait 5 minutes and download** - Should still work
4. **Check storage info**: `/api/ybb/storage/info`
5. **Monitor logs** for reduced 404 errors

## 🎉 Expected Results

- **✅ Eliminated**: Immediate 404 errors after export creation
- **✅ Improved**: User experience with reliable downloads  
- **✅ Maintained**: Automatic storage management
- **✅ Balanced**: Performance vs. availability trade-off
